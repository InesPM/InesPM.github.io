      Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright extragalactic radio flashes and some of the shortest known
      astrophysical transients. In this thesis I investigated the properties of repeating and one-off FRBs to
      study their links to neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields (magnetars), using multi-frequency
      observations and searches across radio and X-rays.
